# Csv2Hive
Csv2Hive is a useful tool for the Big Data. It discovers automatically schemas in CSV files, generates the 'CREATE TABLE' statements and creates Hive tables. You don't need to writes any schemas at all. Csv2Hive is a really fast solution for integrating the whole CSV files into your DataLake.
